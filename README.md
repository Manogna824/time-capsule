Project Description: Digital Time Capsule Platform
Project Goal: To develop a robust and user-friendly web platform for creating, storing, and sharing digital "time capsules" that preserve memories, cultural heritage, and personal milestones over time.

Problem Statement: Existing memory preservation solutions are fragmented and lack a centralized, secure, and engaging platform for collaborative memory curation. This project aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive platform that allows users to create, store, and share digital capsules containing various media types, with options for time-locked access and communal contribution.

Platform Features:

Capsule Creation:
Users can create digital capsules containing text, images, and videos.
Intuitive interface for uploading and organizing media.
Option to add metadata (date, location, tags, descriptions) to each capsule and individual items within.
Time-Locked Access:
Users can set a future date for their capsules to be unlocked.
Automated notification system to alert users when a capsule is ready to be opened.
Collaborative Capsules:
Support for multiple users to contribute to a single capsule.
Permissions management to control who can view and edit capsules.
Communal spaces for shared experiences (e.g., event documentation, group journaling).
User Authentication and Security:
Secure user registration and login using OAuth2 or JWT.
Data encryption to protect user privacy.
Access control to ensure only authorized users can view and modify capsules.
Media Storage:
Integration with cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Firebase Storage) for efficient media handling.
Optimized media delivery for fast loading times.
User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX):
Intuitive and visually appealing design.
Easy navigation and search functionality.
Responsive design for seamless access across devices.
Community Features:
Ability to share capsules with selected users or make them public.
Search and Filter:
Robust search functionality to find capsules or items within capsules.
Filtering by date, tags, or contributors.
Optional Features (Enhancements):

AI/ML Integration:
Sentiment analysis of text entries.
Automatic photo tagging and organization.
AI-based recommendations for related content.
Gamification:
Achievements and badges for consistent contributions.
Interactive elements to encourage engagement.
Blockchain Integration (Optional):
Storing a hash of each capsule on a blockchain for immutability and authenticity.
Calendar View:
A calendar view that shows when capsules will be opened.
Technology Stack:

Front-End: React.js
Back-End: Node.js/Express.js
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
Media Storage: AWS S3 or Firebase Storage
Authentication: OAuth2 or JWT
Hosting: Heroku, AWS, or Netlify
Target Users:
